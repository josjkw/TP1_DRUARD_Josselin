Program.cs contains methods that run the entire tp at once. It might be hard to read, especially for the first exercice which prints a lot of elements. You can run them independently just by commenting (using //) the parts you don't want to run.

Tables.run_EXO_1(); -> exercice 1
Quick_Math.run_EXO_2(); -> exercise 2
Catch_Me_If_You_Can.run_EXO_3(); -> exercise 3
Rectangle.draw_rectangle(); -> exercise 4
XTree.draw_tree(); -> exercise 5

Please note that all the numeric variables are int based. It means that an overflow may occur, especially regarding the Fibonnaci and factorial exercise.
